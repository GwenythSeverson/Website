# Website
# This website is essentially a linkedin page that goes in depth about me. I am coding it in HTML to showcase some skills, as well as in depth information of things I have done in classes and projects. I'm not sure if this is something I am going to develop for showcasing in internship and job applications, but I will hope that I can at least learn a little from this. 

# note, this website is linked with netlify, so every commit is automatically deployed to the link:
#gwenyth.netlify.app
